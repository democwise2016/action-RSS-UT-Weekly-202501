But due to CCP censorship,. discussion inside the Great Firewall is now completely banned. But what can’t be spoken inside,. will be spread by me outside the wall and by all of you viewers. Yu Menglong’s injustice is not an isolated case in China. Let me list a few similar cases since 2015. CCTV host Bian Ce, age 32. Actor Qiao Renliang, age 29. Singer Ben Xi, age 22. Actress Ren Jiao, age 29. Including earlier, at Zhiyuan Middle School in Jiangxi. Hu Xinyu, only 15 years old. All died mysteriously at a young age. Yet the CCP police gave the same explanation:. “Su*cide” or “accident,”. without credible evidence. Which triggered widespread doubt among families and the public. For example, Bian Ce’s mother. also questioned her son’s cause of death,. saying her child never touched drugs. Even just an hour before the incident,. he was still on the phone with her. As for Beijing police. claiming her son died from drug use after falling,. with two small packets of drugs and straws beside him,. she felt deeply puzzled. She asked: after falling from the 16th floor,. those two packets of drugs and straws. just happened to land neatly right beside him? This makes no sense at all. It’s more like someone deliberately placed them there. She suspected it was a murder involving powerful figures. But the CCP police simply. avoided the key points,. closed the case hastily,. just like in Yu Menglong’s case. So when CCP announcements lack credibility,. the public tends to believe unofficial reports. Yet only hard evidence and truth. can truly stop rumors. But the police have yet to release any. Instead, they accuse the public. of “spreading rumors” and “fabricating lies,”. completely disregarding human life. Oh right—. Hello everyone, welcome back to this week’s Pink News Report. If you’re watching this show for the first time,. just a reminder—. you’re now watching. what’s called the “Chinese version of Discovery.”. And I’m your internship mentor in China,. AKA “centrist voter,”. Potter King. If you don’t mind being a Chinese Taiwanese,. congratulations—. you’ve found this program. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Remember to subscribe,. and let’s take a look at the real China together. Last episode we talked about Yu Menglong’s case. For those who haven’t watched that video,. you can check it out later,. so more people can understand this case. Because the discussion heat on this issue. is already fading away. A big reason behind this. is the CCP government’s suppression. So today I’d like to take this opportunity. to update you on Yu Menglong’s case,. and at the same time. let everyone understand. the CCP’s usual methods of silencing speech. Through real-life cases,. we’ll see how the CCP systematically controls. the issues they don’t want people to discuss. After a one-minute ad,. Following Yu Menglong’s death,. the CCP saw that deleting posts and banning accounts inside the wall. still couldn’t suppress public opinion. So the authorities finally spoke up. But not to follow public opinion. by opening a proper investigation. The CCP didn’t intend to reveal the truth for Yu Menglong. Instead, they chose to crack down first. on Chinese netizens discussing the case. Let’s take a look at the official statement. It’s a long one—. but the main point is clear:. they will continue “cleansing the internet”. to crack down on so-called rumors. Regarding Yu’s fall from a building,. they claim some people just wanted attention,. maliciously spreading false information online,. and producing fake videos. They said three people have been punished by law. Including claims that Yu was set up, assaulted, and then fell,. that he was hung from a high building,. had his nails pulled out,. was cut open and thrown down,. and that his mother was being controlled, etc. They said these were all lies. They also said the arrested people had confessed. But given the CCP police’s usual ways,. the number of times they force confessions—. I don’t need to spell it out. We can see that. the authorities didn’t even open a case to investigate,. but instead used a few simple lines. to gloss over everything,. saying it was all fabricated,. and even hinting at threats,. saying they’ll keep arresting those who “spread rumors.”. After everyone waited so long,. the first notice they issued. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">turned out to be a crackdown. on all Chinese netizens seeking justice for Yu. After reading this police bulletin,. I felt they didn’t need to write that long,. because they never intended to handle it. Next time they could just write four words:. “What can you do?”. After the death occurred,. within 24 hours they set the line:. it was an accident. And even the studio that Yu himself had already dissolved. issued a statement on his behalf,. saying criminal suspicion had been ruled out. A film star with over twenty million followers in China. dies in a case full of doubts,. yet there’s no case opened,. no autopsy,. no farewell ceremony,. no surveillance footage. Yu wasn’t some heinous criminal,. nor did he die of an infectious disease,. yet right after his death. he was immediately sent for cremation. To silence an artist with no wrongdoing. to this extent—. is that normal? Even Yu’s mother issued a statement herself,. with her fingerprint,. asking everyone to seek justice for her son,. yet in the authorities’ eyes that’s “rumor” too. It makes no sense. Allow me to point out something:. though there’s been lots of messy online “exposés,”. they’re chaotic—. but the core of this whole matter,. the biggest controversy,. is that insiders’ leaks all indicate. involvement of senior CCP official Cai Qi. They allege Cai Qi’s illegitimate son. toyed with Yu to death. Hence the total blackout on Yu,. and even questioning his cause of death is forbidden. Beyond the obvious total blackout. that everyone can see,. another Chinese blogger,. Lin Beichuan, came forward to confirm,. a retired Chinese soldier. He later spoke up for Yu inside the wall,. and now he’s disappeared. He had posted, revealing that. orders had been handed down from somewhere. to “pay no attention” to Yu’s case,. not to discuss it,. and to settle it quickly. His last post said he. was called to Beijing from Hong Kong,. stressing he was “called,”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">so he couldn’t refuse. But after he was called to Beijing on September 19,. someone who used to post almost daily. up to now—. the cutoff for this video is the 25th—. he hasn’t posted again. Even his posts supporting Yu. have been deleted. Another Chinese actress, Sun Lin,. also questioned Yu’s cause of death,. pleading with the police not to close the case. There are still many doubts to verify. But soon after her post went up,. it was deleted in seconds. On the night of the 21st, when she went out,. she was attacked:. someone threw a flowerpot from above, hitting her head,. and she received anonymous threats,. warning her. to stop speaking up,. or her Weibo would be shut down. They said this was just a “small lesson.”. Another key indicator:. Xiang Tai, who often gossips about celebrities inside the wall,. didn’t dare comment on Yu. Chinese netizens flooded her livestream with,. “Help Yu.”. She replied directly:. “Stop spamming.”. I can’t talk about this. But although she avoided mentioning Yu Menglong,. she still had things to say about the unspoken rules. in China’s entertainment industry. She hinted that. men face this too. It seemed like she said nothing,. yet it felt like she said everything. And Yu’s close friend while alive, Hua Chenyu,. recently, at the Foshan Music Festival,. performed his own song,. “I Really Wish I Could Come Back,”. and specifically changed to a new visual backdrop. The visuals subtly suggested. a man being thrown downward by a black hand,. and by the end, another hand. catches the falling man. Another Chinese artist, Jackson Yee (Yi Yangqianxi),. also suddenly went live—. but didn’t interact with viewers at all,. just stacked stones with a somber look. Let me show you a short clip,. so you can watch his expression change. You can see that many Chinese entertainers. know the industry’s inside stories,. yet no one dares to speak up. When the CCP suppressed discussion of Yu’s case,. besides banning netizens from discussing it,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">they also set up a new target to attack—. Jun Ji-hyun. Let me briefly explain the Jun Ji-hyun issue. There’s a new K-drama on Disney+. called “Storm Zone.”. In it, Jun Ji-hyun plays a UN ambassador. There’s a line that says,. “Why would China prefer war?”. The “little pinks” seized on that and started hurling abuse,. accusing her of “insulting China.”. But the point is,. the line Jun says in the show—. “Why would China prefer war?”—. is her character questioning it. Because in this spy-thriller’s setup,. if war breaks out,. the nuclear blast location. would also affect China in the story. So Jun’s character. says that line. Her character’s logic. is that war would not benefit China,. so she finds the push for war suspicious. Sorry for the spoiler. But in the show, Jun Ji-hyun. actually seeks help from China’s ambassador. In fact, her character speaks up for China. She’s trying to clear up a misunderstanding. But many who never watched the original,. Chinese netizens and “little pinks,”. were blindly steered by bot armies. As a result, inside the firewall. there were tons of posts attacking Jun Ji-hyun. Allow me to remind everyone again:. China’s internet is censored. What you may discuss,. and what you may not,. as Yu’s case already showed,. should be clear to you. So think about this:. why can such a trivial matter about Jun,. and one fabricated at that,. blow up across the internal internet? Exactly. It’s just as you suspect:. it’s allowed by the CCP. Inside the wall, it’s rule by men. The CCP doesn’t want the public discussing. Yu, persecuted by high-ranking officials,. so they want you distracted. by attacking another innocent—Jun Ji-hyun. I must say, this so-called “insulting China” case. is different from past ones. I’ve covered many such incidents before,. where the “little pinks” lashed out,. but this time it’s different,. because this is 100%. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">driven by CCP cyber-armies. Take a look at these attack pieces:. they claim she read the script, so she’s not innocent; that the show smears China as warmongering; that it uses fabric with yellow stars as a carpet; that the villains speak Chinese; and that it vilifies Dalian and Hong Kong, etc. These astroturf marketing accounts. are the ones truly smearing others. If you’ve watched the show,. you’ll know. the starry carpet scene is set in the White House,. and the crew used it to recreate the real setting. 299. Take a look at President Biden’s earlier video tour. See? You saw it, right? The real White House carpet does have stars. And that’s because the U.S. flag. itself has stars, okay? Also, the villains in that show are Koreans themselves,. not Chinese. Nor does it smear Dalian or Hong Kong or anything like that. But the posts inside the firewall. keep churning out piece after piece,. sounding all “credible,”. and the narrative gets steered. Uninformed Chinese netizens. are used to attack Jun Ji-hyun,. thinking they’re righteous. I find it ironic. Stirred-up netizens go after Jun Ji-hyun. while forgetting their fellow Chinese. are the ones being persecuted. Yu Menglong hadn’t even been laid to rest,. before CCP bot armies spun the story away,. and the authorities suppressed public opinion. From this case you should understand:. Menglong won’t be the last,. and neither will Jun Ji-hyun be the only target. The CCP is good at manufacturing enemies. for the public to attack,. to divert attention from what’s happening at home. Taking a step back, though,. if the “little pinks” truly think Jun insulted China,. she’s just acting,. she didn’t write the script. If you’re really that upset,. Chinese netizens shouldn’t support the Korea-ban; I suggest doing the opposite:. the “little pinks” should fund Korean artists. to shoot pro-CCP patriotic films. Don’t you say the motherland is powerful? Whatever the fee is,. have Chinese producers. pay a hundred times more and hire Jun Ji-hyun,. and have her, in a patriotic CCP film,. shout “I love China.”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Wouldn’t that be great? Otherwise, why are you yelling while watching pirated copies? So, what did you think of today’s video? Feel free to share in the comments below. In the latter part of today’s video,. let me show you a few. “self-own” comments on the channel. “I’m watching from beyond the wall, but I’m not a little pink.”. “So don’t call everyone who climbs the wall a little pink.”. Looks like you’re new here. Let me remind you of one thing:. if it’s not your seat,. don’t sit in it. The wording I use on this show. is carefully considered. I strive to be precise. Of course I know. there are Chinese people we can talk to. and there are party-blind “little pinks.”. So when I refer to Chinese people,. I say “Chinese netizens outside the wall.”. Likewise, when I mean the little pinks,. I say “little pinks outside the wall.”. Clear enough? Lately I kind of feel. Taiwan and China have flipped. I’m seeing many Chinese. gradually waking up,. while some in Taiwan. are moving closer to the CCP. Like this one:. “Isn’t Taiwan part of China?”. “Why can Taiwan talk about it,. but people inside the wall can’t?”. That made me think they watched my video. and started to reflect. Next one:. “It’s meaningless to elevate an isolated case to a national level.”. “Which country doesn’t have money–power–sex deals?”. With Yu Menglong wronged like that,. you still say such nonsense? If you’re not a CCP troll. sent here on a cleanup mission,. I’d suspect you might be one of the perpetrators. Using a burner account to comment here. CCP bot armies, stop muddying the waters. with “other countries do it too,”. or “don’t make it a national issue.”. That’s whitewashing. Back to the core question:. let me ask you—. who took Yu Menglong’s life? Multiple pieces of evidence and insider leaks. point straight to a senior official’s child. persecuted by the red second and third generations. Why do they dare do this? Because they control China,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and officials shield one another. They know they have the CCP regime backing them. That’s why they dare to do whatever they want inside the wall,. and then suppress Chinese netizens afterward,. not allowing them to speak up for Yu Menglong. The ones doing all this. are the CCP authorities. So you’re saying this matter. is something I alone elevated to a national level? Absolutely not. The ones who persecuted Yu Menglong. are the CCP authorities. It’s the CCP government suppressing the Chinese people. It’s your state persecuting your fellow citizens. Every country has bad actors,. but wrongdoers in other countries. can they act like the CCP princelings? Suppose this happened in Taiwan:. an official’s illegitimate son colludes with a celebrity. to abuse another star—. it would absolutely rock the country. The media would report it morning, noon, night—and late-night. Taiwanese netizens would share and discuss it online,. and they wouldn’t be purged or banned. In the end, besides that politician. getting blasted out of office,. people would support jailing the perpetrators. Prosecutors would open a case. So compared with Yu Menglong’s case,. where the CCP deployed state machinery. to suppress, persecute, and silence,. it’s entirely different. Ha—trying to cover up the SET executive’s son assaulting a woman? Using lies to cover facts—. so “humane,” huh? I’m speechless. This idiot is here to whitewash too,. and trying to slap a label on me. The case of SET vice GM’s son, Gong Yiting, assaulting an actress—. what’s there to be afraid to talk about? If you dared say that to my face,. I’d land a full combo on you. People like you are scum. Why are you conflating two real tragedies? Yu Menglong has already “logged off,”. and you say I’m spreading rumors? What’s wrong with you? Besides, in my work. I’ve collaborated with Chiang Tsu-ping,. whom I respect deeply,. and she’s very kind in private. So regarding what she went through,. I’m really saddened,. and I truly hope Taiwan’s judiciary. gives her justice. The point is—this case. has been formally opened in Taiwan. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">You can look up the news online. Gong Yiting is currently barred from leaving the country. People can discuss it online freely. This is completely different from Yu Menglong’s case. Tying the two together—. all I can say is, if you’re not using your brain,. go donate it. </p>

But due to CCP censorship,. discussion inside the Great Firewall is now completely banned. But what can’t be spoken inside,. will be spread by me outside the wall and by all of you viewers. Yu Menglong’s injustice is not an isolated case in China. Let me list a few similar cases since 2015. CCTV host Bian Ce, age 32. Actor Qiao Renliang, age 29. Singer Ben Xi, age 22. Actress Ren Jiao, age 29. Including earlier, at Zhiyuan Middle School in Jiangxi. Hu Xinyu, only 15 years old. All died mysteriously at a young age. Yet the CCP police gave the same explanation:. “Su*cide” or “accident,”. without credible evidence. Which triggered widespread doubt among families and the public. For example, Bian Ce’s mother. also questioned her son’s cause of death,. saying her child never touched drugs. Even just an hour before the incident,. he was still on the phone with her. As for Beijing police. claiming her son died from drug use after falling,. with two small packets of drugs and straws beside him,. she felt deeply puzzled. She asked: after falling from the 16th floor,. those two packets of drugs and straws. just happened to land neatly right beside him? This makes no sense at all. It’s more like someone deliberately placed them there. She suspected it was a murder involving powerful figures. But the CCP police simply. avoided the key points,. closed the case hastily,. just like in Yu Menglong’s case. So when CCP announcements lack credibility,. the public tends to believe unofficial reports. Yet only hard evidence and truth. can truly stop rumors. But the police have yet to release any. Instead, they accuse the public. of “spreading rumors” and “fabricating lies,”. completely disregarding human life. Oh right—. Hello everyone, welcome back to this week’s Pink News Report. If you’re watching this show for the first time,. just a reminder—. you’re now watching. what’s called the “Chinese version of Discovery.”. And I’m your internship mentor in China,. AKA “centrist voter,”. Potter King. If you don’t mind being a Chinese Taiwanese,. congratulations—. you’ve found this program. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Remember to subscribe,. and let’s take a look at the real China together. Last episode we talked about Yu Menglong’s case. For those who haven’t watched that video,. you can check it out later,. so more people can understand this case. Because the discussion heat on this issue. is already fading away. A big reason behind this. is the CCP government’s suppression. So today I’d like to take this opportunity. to update you on Yu Menglong’s case,. and at the same time. let everyone understand. the CCP’s usual methods of silencing speech. Through real-life cases,. we’ll see how the CCP systematically controls. the issues they don’t want people to discuss. After a one-minute ad,. Following Yu Menglong’s death,. the CCP saw that deleting posts and banning accounts inside the wall. still couldn’t suppress public opinion. So the authorities finally spoke up. But not to follow public opinion. by opening a proper investigation. The CCP didn’t intend to reveal the truth for Yu Menglong. Instead, they chose to crack down first. on Chinese netizens discussing the case. Let’s take a look at the official statement. It’s a long one—. but the main point is clear:. they will continue “cleansing the internet”. to crack down on so-called rumors. Regarding Yu’s fall from a building,. they claim some people just wanted attention,. maliciously spreading false information online,. and producing fake videos. They said three people have been punished by law. Including claims that Yu was set up, assaulted, and then fell,. that he was hung from a high building,. had his nails pulled out,. was cut open and thrown down,. and that his mother was being controlled, etc. They said these were all lies. They also said the arrested people had confessed. But given the CCP police’s usual ways,. the number of times they force confessions—. I don’t need to spell it out. We can see that. the authorities didn’t even open a case to investigate,. but instead used a few simple lines. to gloss over everything,. saying it was all fabricated,. and even hinting at threats,. saying they’ll keep arresting those who “spread rumors.”. After everyone waited so long,. the first notice they issued. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">turned out to be a crackdown. on all Chinese netizens seeking justice for Yu. After reading this police bulletin,. I felt they didn’t need to write that long,. because they never intended to handle it. Next time they could just write four words:. “What can you do?”. After the death occurred,. within 24 hours they set the line:. it was an accident. And even the studio that Yu himself had already dissolved. issued a statement on his behalf,. saying criminal suspicion had been ruled out. A film star with over twenty million followers in China. dies in a case full of doubts,. yet there’s no case opened,. no autopsy,. no farewell ceremony,. no surveillance footage. Yu wasn’t some heinous criminal,. nor did he die of an infectious disease,. yet right after his death. he was immediately sent for cremation. To silence an artist with no wrongdoing. to this extent—. is that normal? Even Yu’s mother issued a statement herself,. with her fingerprint,. asking everyone to seek justice for her son,. yet in the authorities’ eyes that’s “rumor” too. It makes no sense. Allow me to point out something:. though there’s been lots of messy online “exposés,”. they’re chaotic—. but the core of this whole matter,. the biggest controversy,. is that insiders’ leaks all indicate. involvement of senior CCP official Cai Qi. They allege Cai Qi’s illegitimate son. toyed with Yu to death. Hence the total blackout on Yu,. and even questioning his cause of death is forbidden. Beyond the obvious total blackout. that everyone can see,. another Chinese blogger,. Lin Beichuan, came forward to confirm,. a retired Chinese soldier. He later spoke up for Yu inside the wall,. and now he’s disappeared. He had posted, revealing that. orders had been handed down from somewhere. to “pay no attention” to Yu’s case,. not to discuss it,. and to settle it quickly. His last post said he. was called to Beijing from Hong Kong,. stressing he was “called,”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">so he couldn’t refuse. But after he was called to Beijing on September 19,. someone who used to post almost daily. up to now—. the cutoff for this video is the 25th—. he hasn’t posted again. Even his posts supporting Yu. have been deleted. Another Chinese actress, Sun Lin,. also questioned Yu’s cause of death,. pleading with the police not to close the case. There are still many doubts to verify. But soon after her post went up,. it was deleted in seconds. On the night of the 21st, when she went out,. she was attacked:. someone threw a flowerpot from above, hitting her head,. and she received anonymous threats,. warning her. to stop speaking up,. or her Weibo would be shut down. They said this was just a “small lesson.”. Another key indicator:. Xiang Tai, who often gossips about celebrities inside the wall,. didn’t dare comment on Yu. Chinese netizens flooded her livestream with,. “Help Yu.”. She replied directly:. “Stop spamming.”. I can’t talk about this. But although she avoided mentioning Yu Menglong,. she still had things to say about the unspoken rules. in China’s entertainment industry. She hinted that. men face this too. It seemed like she said nothing,. yet it felt like she said everything. And Yu’s close friend while alive, Hua Chenyu,. recently, at the Foshan Music Festival,. performed his own song,. “I Really Wish I Could Come Back,”. and specifically changed to a new visual backdrop. The visuals subtly suggested. a man being thrown downward by a black hand,. and by the end, another hand. catches the falling man. Another Chinese artist, Jackson Yee (Yi Yangqianxi),. also suddenly went live—. but didn’t interact with viewers at all,. just stacked stones with a somber look. Let me show you a short clip,. so you can watch his expression change. You can see that many Chinese entertainers. know the industry’s inside stories,. yet no one dares to speak up. When the CCP suppressed discussion of Yu’s case,. besides banning netizens from discussing it,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">they also set up a new target to attack—. Jun Ji-hyun. Let me briefly explain the Jun Ji-hyun issue. There’s a new K-drama on Disney+. called “Storm Zone.”. In it, Jun Ji-hyun plays a UN ambassador. There’s a line that says,. “Why would China prefer war?”. The “little pinks” seized on that and started hurling abuse,. accusing her of “insulting China.”. But the point is,. the line Jun says in the show—. “Why would China prefer war?”—. is her character questioning it. Because in this spy-thriller’s setup,. if war breaks out,. the nuclear blast location. would also affect China in the story. So Jun’s character. says that line. Her character’s logic. is that war would not benefit China,. so she finds the push for war suspicious. Sorry for the spoiler. But in the show, Jun Ji-hyun. actually seeks help from China’s ambassador. In fact, her character speaks up for China. She’s trying to clear up a misunderstanding. But many who never watched the original,. Chinese netizens and “little pinks,”. were blindly steered by bot armies. As a result, inside the firewall. there were tons of posts attacking Jun Ji-hyun. Allow me to remind everyone again:. China’s internet is censored. What you may discuss,. and what you may not,. as Yu’s case already showed,. should be clear to you. So think about this:. why can such a trivial matter about Jun,. and one fabricated at that,. blow up across the internal internet? Exactly. It’s just as you suspect:. it’s allowed by the CCP. Inside the wall, it’s rule by men. The CCP doesn’t want the public discussing. Yu, persecuted by high-ranking officials,. so they want you distracted. by attacking another innocent—Jun Ji-hyun. I must say, this so-called “insulting China” case. is different from past ones. I’ve covered many such incidents before,. where the “little pinks” lashed out,. but this time it’s different,. because this is 100%. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">driven by CCP cyber-armies. Take a look at these attack pieces:. they claim she read the script, so she’s not innocent; that the show smears China as warmongering; that it uses fabric with yellow stars as a carpet; that the villains speak Chinese; and that it vilifies Dalian and Hong Kong, etc. These astroturf marketing accounts. are the ones truly smearing others. If you’ve watched the show,. you’ll know. the starry carpet scene is set in the White House,. and the crew used it to recreate the real setting. 299. Take a look at President Biden’s earlier video tour. See? You saw it, right? The real White House carpet does have stars. And that’s because the U.S. flag. itself has stars, okay? Also, the villains in that show are Koreans themselves,. not Chinese. Nor does it smear Dalian or Hong Kong or anything like that. But the posts inside the firewall. keep churning out piece after piece,. sounding all “credible,”. and the narrative gets steered. Uninformed Chinese netizens. are used to attack Jun Ji-hyun,. thinking they’re righteous. I find it ironic. Stirred-up netizens go after Jun Ji-hyun. while forgetting their fellow Chinese. are the ones being persecuted. Yu Menglong hadn’t even been laid to rest,. before CCP bot armies spun the story away,. and the authorities suppressed public opinion. From this case you should understand:. Menglong won’t be the last,. and neither will Jun Ji-hyun be the only target. The CCP is good at manufacturing enemies. for the public to attack,. to divert attention from what’s happening at home. Taking a step back, though,. if the “little pinks” truly think Jun insulted China,. she’s just acting,. she didn’t write the script. If you’re really that upset,. Chinese netizens shouldn’t support the Korea-ban; I suggest doing the opposite:. the “little pinks” should fund Korean artists. to shoot pro-CCP patriotic films. Don’t you say the motherland is powerful? Whatever the fee is,. have Chinese producers. pay a hundred times more and hire Jun Ji-hyun,. and have her, in a patriotic CCP film,. shout “I love China.”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Wouldn’t that be great? Otherwise, why are you yelling while watching pirated copies? So, what did you think of today’s video? Feel free to share in the comments below. In the latter part of today’s video,. let me show you a few. “self-own” comments on the channel. “I’m watching from beyond the wall, but I’m not a little pink.”. “So don’t call everyone who climbs the wall a little pink.”. Looks like you’re new here. Let me remind you of one thing:. if it’s not your seat,. don’t sit in it. The wording I use on this show. is carefully considered. I strive to be precise. Of course I know. there are Chinese people we can talk to. and there are party-blind “little pinks.”. So when I refer to Chinese people,. I say “Chinese netizens outside the wall.”. Likewise, when I mean the little pinks,. I say “little pinks outside the wall.”. Clear enough? Lately I kind of feel. Taiwan and China have flipped. I’m seeing many Chinese. gradually waking up,. while some in Taiwan. are moving closer to the CCP. Like this one:. “Isn’t Taiwan part of China?”. “Why can Taiwan talk about it,. but people inside the wall can’t?”. That made me think they watched my video. and started to reflect. Next one:. “It’s meaningless to elevate an isolated case to a national level.”. “Which country doesn’t have money–power–sex deals?”. With Yu Menglong wronged like that,. you still say such nonsense? If you’re not a CCP troll. sent here on a cleanup mission,. I’d suspect you might be one of the perpetrators. Using a burner account to comment here. CCP bot armies, stop muddying the waters. with “other countries do it too,”. or “don’t make it a national issue.”. That’s whitewashing. Back to the core question:. let me ask you—. who took Yu Menglong’s life? Multiple pieces of evidence and insider leaks. point straight to a senior official’s child. persecuted by the red second and third generations. Why do they dare do this? Because they control China,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and officials shield one another. They know they have the CCP regime backing them. That’s why they dare to do whatever they want inside the wall,. and then suppress Chinese netizens afterward,. not allowing them to speak up for Yu Menglong. The ones doing all this. are the CCP authorities. So you’re saying this matter. is something I alone elevated to a national level? Absolutely not. The ones who persecuted Yu Menglong. are the CCP authorities. It’s the CCP government suppressing the Chinese people. It’s your state persecuting your fellow citizens. Every country has bad actors,. but wrongdoers in other countries. can they act like the CCP princelings? Suppose this happened in Taiwan:. an official’s illegitimate son colludes with a celebrity. to abuse another star—. it would absolutely rock the country. The media would report it morning, noon, night—and late-night. Taiwanese netizens would share and discuss it online,. and they wouldn’t be purged or banned. In the end, besides that politician. getting blasted out of office,. people would support jailing the perpetrators. Prosecutors would open a case. So compared with Yu Menglong’s case,. where the CCP deployed state machinery. to suppress, persecute, and silence,. it’s entirely different. Ha—trying to cover up the SET executive’s son assaulting a woman? Using lies to cover facts—. so “humane,” huh? I’m speechless. This idiot is here to whitewash too,. and trying to slap a label on me. The case of SET vice GM’s son, Gong Yiting, assaulting an actress—. what’s there to be afraid to talk about? If you dared say that to my face,. I’d land a full combo on you. People like you are scum. Why are you conflating two real tragedies? Yu Menglong has already “logged off,”. and you say I’m spreading rumors? What’s wrong with you? Besides, in my work. I’ve collaborated with Chiang Tsu-ping,. whom I respect deeply,. and she’s very kind in private. So regarding what she went through,. I’m really saddened,. and I truly hope Taiwan’s judiciary. gives her justice. The point is—this case. has been formally opened in Taiwan. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">You can look up the news online. Gong Yiting is currently barred from leaving the country. People can discuss it online freely. This is completely different from Yu Menglong’s case. Tying the two together—. all I can say is, if you’re not using your brain,. go donate it. </p>

But due to CCP censorship,. discussion inside the Great Firewall is now completely banned. But what can’t be spoken inside,. will be spread by me outside the wall and by all of you viewers. Yu Menglong’s injustice is not an isolated case in China. Let me list a few similar cases since 2015. CCTV host Bian Ce, age 32. Actor Qiao Renliang, age 29. Singer Ben Xi, age 22. Actress Ren Jiao, age 29. Including earlier, at Zhiyuan Middle School in Jiangxi. Hu Xinyu, only 15 years old. All died mysteriously at a young age. Yet the CCP police gave the same explanation:. “Su*cide” or “accident,”. without credible evidence. Which triggered widespread doubt among families and the public. For example, Bian Ce’s mother. also questioned her son’s cause of death,. saying her child never touched drugs. Even just an hour before the incident,. he was still on the phone with her. As for Beijing police. claiming her son died from drug use after falling,. with two small packets of drugs and straws beside him,. she felt deeply puzzled. She asked: after falling from the 16th floor,. those two packets of drugs and straws. just happened to land neatly right beside him? This makes no sense at all. It’s more like someone deliberately placed them there. She suspected it was a murder involving powerful figures. But the CCP police simply. avoided the key points,. closed the case hastily,. just like in Yu Menglong’s case. So when CCP announcements lack credibility,. the public tends to believe unofficial reports. Yet only hard evidence and truth. can truly stop rumors. But the police have yet to release any. Instead, they accuse the public. of “spreading rumors” and “fabricating lies,”. completely disregarding human life. Oh right—. Hello everyone, welcome back to this week’s Pink News Report. If you’re watching this show for the first time,. just a reminder—. you’re now watching. what’s called the “Chinese version of Discovery.”. And I’m your internship mentor in China,. AKA “centrist voter,”. Potter King. If you don’t mind being a Chinese Taiwanese,. congratulations—. you’ve found this program. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Remember to subscribe,. and let’s take a look at the real China together. Last episode we talked about Yu Menglong’s case. For those who haven’t watched that video,. you can check it out later,. so more people can understand this case. Because the discussion heat on this issue. is already fading away. A big reason behind this. is the CCP government’s suppression. So today I’d like to take this opportunity. to update you on Yu Menglong’s case,. and at the same time. let everyone understand. the CCP’s usual methods of silencing speech. Through real-life cases,. we’ll see how the CCP systematically controls. the issues they don’t want people to discuss. After a one-minute ad,. Following Yu Menglong’s death,. the CCP saw that deleting posts and banning accounts inside the wall. still couldn’t suppress public opinion. So the authorities finally spoke up. But not to follow public opinion. by opening a proper investigation. The CCP didn’t intend to reveal the truth for Yu Menglong. Instead, they chose to crack down first. on Chinese netizens discussing the case. Let’s take a look at the official statement. It’s a long one—. but the main point is clear:. they will continue “cleansing the internet”. to crack down on so-called rumors. Regarding Yu’s fall from a building,. they claim some people just wanted attention,. maliciously spreading false information online,. and producing fake videos. They said three people have been punished by law. Including claims that Yu was set up, assaulted, and then fell,. that he was hung from a high building,. had his nails pulled out,. was cut open and thrown down,. and that his mother was being controlled, etc. They said these were all lies. They also said the arrested people had confessed. But given the CCP police’s usual ways,. the number of times they force confessions—. I don’t need to spell it out. We can see that. the authorities didn’t even open a case to investigate,. but instead used a few simple lines. to gloss over everything,. saying it was all fabricated,. and even hinting at threats,. saying they’ll keep arresting those who “spread rumors.”. After everyone waited so long,. the first notice they issued. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">turned out to be a crackdown. on all Chinese netizens seeking justice for Yu. After reading this police bulletin,. I felt they didn’t need to write that long,. because they never intended to handle it. Next time they could just write four words:. “What can you do?”. After the death occurred,. within 24 hours they set the line:. it was an accident. And even the studio that Yu himself had already dissolved. issued a statement on his behalf,. saying criminal suspicion had been ruled out. A film star with over twenty million followers in China. dies in a case full of doubts,. yet there’s no case opened,. no autopsy,. no farewell ceremony,. no surveillance footage. Yu wasn’t some heinous criminal,. nor did he die of an infectious disease,. yet right after his death. he was immediately sent for cremation. To silence an artist with no wrongdoing. to this extent—. is that normal? Even Yu’s mother issued a statement herself,. with her fingerprint,. asking everyone to seek justice for her son,. yet in the authorities’ eyes that’s “rumor” too. It makes no sense. Allow me to point out something:. though there’s been lots of messy online “exposés,”. they’re chaotic—. but the core of this whole matter,. the biggest controversy,. is that insiders’ leaks all indicate. involvement of senior CCP official Cai Qi. They allege Cai Qi’s illegitimate son. toyed with Yu to death. Hence the total blackout on Yu,. and even questioning his cause of death is forbidden. Beyond the obvious total blackout. that everyone can see,. another Chinese blogger,. Lin Beichuan, came forward to confirm,. a retired Chinese soldier. He later spoke up for Yu inside the wall,. and now he’s disappeared. He had posted, revealing that. orders had been handed down from somewhere. to “pay no attention” to Yu’s case,. not to discuss it,. and to settle it quickly. His last post said he. was called to Beijing from Hong Kong,. stressing he was “called,”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">so he couldn’t refuse. But after he was called to Beijing on September 19,. someone who used to post almost daily. up to now—. the cutoff for this video is the 25th—. he hasn’t posted again. Even his posts supporting Yu. have been deleted. Another Chinese actress, Sun Lin,. also questioned Yu’s cause of death,. pleading with the police not to close the case. There are still many doubts to verify. But soon after her post went up,. it was deleted in seconds. On the night of the 21st, when she went out,. she was attacked:. someone threw a flowerpot from above, hitting her head,. and she received anonymous threats,. warning her. to stop speaking up,. or her Weibo would be shut down. They said this was just a “small lesson.”. Another key indicator:. Xiang Tai, who often gossips about celebrities inside the wall,. didn’t dare comment on Yu. Chinese netizens flooded her livestream with,. “Help Yu.”. She replied directly:. “Stop spamming.”. I can’t talk about this. But although she avoided mentioning Yu Menglong,. she still had things to say about the unspoken rules. in China’s entertainment industry. She hinted that. men face this too. It seemed like she said nothing,. yet it felt like she said everything. And Yu’s close friend while alive, Hua Chenyu,. recently, at the Foshan Music Festival,. performed his own song,. “I Really Wish I Could Come Back,”. and specifically changed to a new visual backdrop. The visuals subtly suggested. a man being thrown downward by a black hand,. and by the end, another hand. catches the falling man. Another Chinese artist, Jackson Yee (Yi Yangqianxi),. also suddenly went live—. but didn’t interact with viewers at all,. just stacked stones with a somber look. Let me show you a short clip,. so you can watch his expression change. You can see that many Chinese entertainers. know the industry’s inside stories,. yet no one dares to speak up. When the CCP suppressed discussion of Yu’s case,. besides banning netizens from discussing it,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">they also set up a new target to attack—. Jun Ji-hyun. Let me briefly explain the Jun Ji-hyun issue. There’s a new K-drama on Disney+. called “Storm Zone.”. In it, Jun Ji-hyun plays a UN ambassador. There’s a line that says,. “Why would China prefer war?”. The “little pinks” seized on that and started hurling abuse,. accusing her of “insulting China.”. But the point is,. the line Jun says in the show—. “Why would China prefer war?”—. is her character questioning it. Because in this spy-thriller’s setup,. if war breaks out,. the nuclear blast location. would also affect China in the story. So Jun’s character. says that line. Her character’s logic. is that war would not benefit China,. so she finds the push for war suspicious. Sorry for the spoiler. But in the show, Jun Ji-hyun. actually seeks help from China’s ambassador. In fact, her character speaks up for China. She’s trying to clear up a misunderstanding. But many who never watched the original,. Chinese netizens and “little pinks,”. were blindly steered by bot armies. As a result, inside the firewall. there were tons of posts attacking Jun Ji-hyun. Allow me to remind everyone again:. China’s internet is censored. What you may discuss,. and what you may not,. as Yu’s case already showed,. should be clear to you. So think about this:. why can such a trivial matter about Jun,. and one fabricated at that,. blow up across the internal internet? Exactly. It’s just as you suspect:. it’s allowed by the CCP. Inside the wall, it’s rule by men. The CCP doesn’t want the public discussing. Yu, persecuted by high-ranking officials,. so they want you distracted. by attacking another innocent—Jun Ji-hyun. I must say, this so-called “insulting China” case. is different from past ones. I’ve covered many such incidents before,. where the “little pinks” lashed out,. but this time it’s different,. because this is 100%. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">driven by CCP cyber-armies. Take a look at these attack pieces:. they claim she read the script, so she’s not innocent; that the show smears China as warmongering; that it uses fabric with yellow stars as a carpet; that the villains speak Chinese; and that it vilifies Dalian and Hong Kong, etc. These astroturf marketing accounts. are the ones truly smearing others. If you’ve watched the show,. you’ll know. the starry carpet scene is set in the White House,. and the crew used it to recreate the real setting. 299. Take a look at President Biden’s earlier video tour. See? You saw it, right? The real White House carpet does have stars. And that’s because the U.S. flag. itself has stars, okay? Also, the villains in that show are Koreans themselves,. not Chinese. Nor does it smear Dalian or Hong Kong or anything like that. But the posts inside the firewall. keep churning out piece after piece,. sounding all “credible,”. and the narrative gets steered. Uninformed Chinese netizens. are used to attack Jun Ji-hyun,. thinking they’re righteous. I find it ironic. Stirred-up netizens go after Jun Ji-hyun. while forgetting their fellow Chinese. are the ones being persecuted. Yu Menglong hadn’t even been laid to rest,. before CCP bot armies spun the story away,. and the authorities suppressed public opinion. From this case you should understand:. Menglong won’t be the last,. and neither will Jun Ji-hyun be the only target. The CCP is good at manufacturing enemies. for the public to attack,. to divert attention from what’s happening at home. Taking a step back, though,. if the “little pinks” truly think Jun insulted China,. she’s just acting,. she didn’t write the script. If you’re really that upset,. Chinese netizens shouldn’t support the Korea-ban; I suggest doing the opposite:. the “little pinks” should fund Korean artists. to shoot pro-CCP patriotic films. Don’t you say the motherland is powerful? Whatever the fee is,. have Chinese producers. pay a hundred times more and hire Jun Ji-hyun,. and have her, in a patriotic CCP film,. shout “I love China.”. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Wouldn’t that be great? Otherwise, why are you yelling while watching pirated copies? So, what did you think of today’s video? Feel free to share in the comments below. In the latter part of today’s video,. let me show you a few. “self-own” comments on the channel. “I’m watching from beyond the wall, but I’m not a little pink.”. “So don’t call everyone who climbs the wall a little pink.”. Looks like you’re new here. Let me remind you of one thing:. if it’s not your seat,. don’t sit in it. The wording I use on this show. is carefully considered. I strive to be precise. Of course I know. there are Chinese people we can talk to. and there are party-blind “little pinks.”. So when I refer to Chinese people,. I say “Chinese netizens outside the wall.”. Likewise, when I mean the little pinks,. I say “little pinks outside the wall.”. Clear enough? Lately I kind of feel. Taiwan and China have flipped. I’m seeing many Chinese. gradually waking up,. while some in Taiwan. are moving closer to the CCP. Like this one:. “Isn’t Taiwan part of China?”. “Why can Taiwan talk about it,. but people inside the wall can’t?”. That made me think they watched my video. and started to reflect. Next one:. “It’s meaningless to elevate an isolated case to a national level.”. “Which country doesn’t have money–power–sex deals?”. With Yu Menglong wronged like that,. you still say such nonsense? If you’re not a CCP troll. sent here on a cleanup mission,. I’d suspect you might be one of the perpetrators. Using a burner account to comment here. CCP bot armies, stop muddying the waters. with “other countries do it too,”. or “don’t make it a national issue.”. That’s whitewashing. Back to the core question:. let me ask you—. who took Yu Menglong’s life? Multiple pieces of evidence and insider leaks. point straight to a senior official’s child. persecuted by the red second and third generations. Why do they dare do this? Because they control China,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and officials shield one another. They know they have the CCP regime backing them. That’s why they dare to do whatever they want inside the wall,. and then suppress Chinese netizens afterward,. not allowing them to speak up for Yu Menglong. The ones doing all this. are the CCP authorities. So you’re saying this matter. is something I alone elevated to a national level? Absolutely not. The ones who persecuted Yu Menglong. are the CCP authorities. It’s the CCP government suppressing the Chinese people. It’s your state persecuting your fellow citizens. Every country has bad actors,. but wrongdoers in other countries. can they act like the CCP princelings? Suppose this happened in Taiwan:. an official’s illegitimate son colludes with a celebrity. to abuse another star—. it would absolutely rock the country. The media would report it morning, noon, night—and late-night. Taiwanese netizens would share and discuss it online,. and they wouldn’t be purged or banned. In the end, besides that politician. getting blasted out of office,. people would support jailing the perpetrators. Prosecutors would open a case. So compared with Yu Menglong’s case,. where the CCP deployed state machinery. to suppress, persecute, and silence,. it’s entirely different. Ha—trying to cover up the SET executive’s son assaulting a woman? Using lies to cover facts—. so “humane,” huh? I’m speechless. This idiot is here to whitewash too,. and trying to slap a label on me. The case of SET vice GM’s son, Gong Yiting, assaulting an actress—. what’s there to be afraid to talk about? If you dared say that to my face,. I’d land a full combo on you. People like you are scum. Why are you conflating two real tragedies? Yu Menglong has already “logged off,”. and you say I’m spreading rumors? What’s wrong with you? Besides, in my work. I’ve collaborated with Chiang Tsu-ping,. whom I respect deeply,. and she’s very kind in private. So regarding what she went through,. I’m really saddened,. and I truly hope Taiwan’s judiciary. gives her justice. The point is—this case. has been formally opened in Taiwan. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">You can look up the news online. Gong Yiting is currently barred from leaving the country. People can discuss it online freely. This is completely different from Yu Menglong’s case. Tying the two together—. all I can say is, if you’re not using your brain,. go donate it. </p>

I’m your intern mentor for being Chinese.（false flag）. AKA the swing voter. Potter King. Some wanted to hear Potter King’s take on the Yu Menglong case. I’m not a fan of Yu. But hearing the news was heartbreaking. Hello, Potter King. Could you talk about the Yu Menglong incident in China’s entertainment industry? This matter may involve many celebrities or high-ranking officials. It has already been suppressed inside China. I hope you can help more people pay attention to it. This week I’ve received several such comments. Hoping I would talk about Yu Menglong’s case. But beforehand I wasn’t familiar with this Chinese star. Nor had I seen any of his dramas. But since so many wanted me to talk about it,. I went to research the case. And after understanding what he went through,. I can only say it’s another tragedy of the CCP’s chives. And I do think this case is full of suspicious points. But just now,. many Taiwanese have accepted CCP propaganda. They think being Chinese. seems pretty good. So in this week’s video,. we’ll learn about Yu Menglong’s ordeal. to get a taste of life as a Chinese inside the Great Firewall. After a one-minute ad,. we’ll get right into today’s topic. First I must say,. this case is hard to explain fully. Because the CCP inside China. has already been maintaining stability on it. A lot of the information is fragmented. I can only piece it together in order. If there are parts I didn’t mention,. I welcome informed viewers. to add them in the comments. OK, let me quickly explain. what exactly happened. It started on September 11 at 1:59 p.m. when a paparazzi inside China posted on Weibo. saying Yu Menglong had fallen to his death. At first the news wasn’t confirmed as true or false. The post only had text plus a few photos from the scene. He said he had confirmed with staff. that the one who fell was Yu Menglong. And in one of the photos,. there was a close-up of the window screen where it happened. At first Chinese netizens. could still discuss how weirdly the screen was broken. They questioned who would cut it open and then jump. The incident site was a luxury apartment project in Chaoyang, Beijing. The Sunshine Upper East community. Later that afternoon,. Yu Menglong’s studio released a statement. confirming his death from falling. He was 37. Still very young. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Although this confirmed. the paparazzi’s report was correct,. what’s strange is. Yu Menglong’s studio replaced the police to announce. that the police had ruled out criminal suspicion. Clearly wanting to frame the case as an accidental fall. But Yu Menglong, as. a male star with 20 million fans in China,. suddenly died like this—. it naturally drew huge attention. It even shot up to number one on Weibo’s trending. And that’s when insiders began revealing. that Yu Menglong didn’t fall by accident,. but was thrown off. And not just once. He was thrown twice. The method was extremely cruel. There was even a video. directly filming the window of the crime scene,. the same one in the leaked photos we saw. But the video. was secretly filmed the night before. So the footage is dark. But you can still clearly hear. Yu Menglong’s heart-wrenching cries for help. With his fear of heights,. he was hung upside down outside a 5th-floor window and toyed with. A reminder—the next clip. may make people uncomfortable. It’s real footage of persecution. If you’re especially empathetic,. consider muting the sound. and just reading the subtitles. Even though this might get yellow-tagged,. I think it’s necessary to show it. Because this video has already been censored inside China. So by posting it here,. I’m also preserving evidence for the victim. Hoping one day his injustice will be redressed. In addition, reports also pointed out that on the night of his fall... There were multiple people at the scene,. including well-known figures from China’s entertainment industry. It’s said Yu Menglong was set up at a gathering that night,. drugged and plied with alcohol,. and then forced to have relations with a man. Afterward, the other party tossed him two Rolex watches,. trying to buy him off. I’ve also reviewed many related materials. and compiled a few key points to share. Yu was targeted when he debuted at 25. Rumor had it a powerful woman in the industry tried to coerce him,. but he refused,. and was blacklisted for three years,. disappearing from public view,. with no job opportunities. By 2017,. he finally landed work again,. appearing in “Eternal Love” (Three Lives, Three Worlds, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms). As his career began to recover,. he was targeted by someone else,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">who tried to force the unspoken rules on him. That person was later identified. as Xin Qi,. birth name Xin Xiaoxiong,. a film producer. You might ask, can a Chinese film producer. really wield such power over an artist? Perhaps not,. but Xin Qi. isn’t an ordinary producer—. he’s a princeling, the child of a senior CCP official. According to news reports,. Xin Qi is suspected to be. the illegitimate son of Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi. With that princeling background,. his backing inside the Great Firewall is extremely strong. Moreover, Cai Qi. is a Xi loyalist who has been heavily favored,. in charge of China’s online surveillance and stability maintenance. With such a patron behind him,. and a system ruled by men, not law,. where the Party decides everything,. you can imagine that. almost no one could touch Xin Qi. Princelings in China can indeed act with impunity. Even if he treats the entertainment world like a brothel,. it wouldn’t be unheard of. But Xin Qi initially adored Yu,. approaching him under the pretext of organizing a fan club,. with the real aim of getting close and monitoring him. After getting familiar with Yu,. he registered two companies in Yu’s name,. using both carrot and stick. to make Yu sign contracts. Once the partnership was bound,. Xin tried to impose the casting-couch rules on him. But Yu had boundaries,. and still refused at all costs. Yet given Xin’s backing,. Yu had no real recourse against him,. essentially with nowhere to turn. In this desperate moment,. Yu happened to discover. that the two companies in his name. were being used by the other side for money laundering—. acting as a white glove for the CCP. So Yu quietly gathered evidence,. and once he had key proof,. he went to deregister the companies. and stored the evidence on a USB drive. Presumably, Yu intended to use this as leverage. to free himself from Xin’s years of harassment. But because he held evidence of a senior CCP official’s laundering,. he touched the Party’s interests,. and in China’s system of official protectionism,. with Yu still physically inside the Great Firewall,. it instead brought fatal danger upon him. That earlier SOS clip you saw. wasn’t captured by chance,. but because Xin planned a setup against Yu. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and brought in paparazzi to film. Xin originally wanted to use a sex scandal as leverage,. but it ended up accidentally capturing. footage of Yu pleading for help while alive. After this news broke inside China,. it’s easy to imagine. the CCP’s opinion-control machinery kicked in at once:. mass deletions on Weibo, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and more. From trending #1 to vanishing into thin air—. Yu was thus erased from public view. Worse still, there’s more:. Yu’s studio. issued yet another statement to whitewash,. this time invoking Yu’s mother’s name,. aiming to quell netizens’ doubts,. claiming he fell accidentally while drunk,. and asking everyone to stop speculating. But once that statement came out,. Yu’s mother herself. apparently did not accept it. The very next day,. Yu Menglong’s mother anonymously posted online herself,. attaching a fingerprinted handprint to prove it was really her. She stayed anonymous because. the CCP had already banned discussion of Yu’s cause of death. But how could a mother who lost her own child. possibly remain silent? With grievance in her heart,. she chose to speak out under a pseudonym. She didn’t use Yu’s real name—. she called herself “Dou E’s mother.”. By the way,. “The Injustice to Dou E” is a Yuan-dynasty zaju by Guan Hanqing,. about a kind woman who was framed,. tortured and forced into a confession. Because both are injustices,. she used “Dou E” as a stand-in. The gist of Yu’s mother’s statement was:. I hope to seek justice for my child who died wronged. The killer’s claim to the public that it was an accident. is false. I hold key footage from before and after the incident,. plus testimony from insiders,. enough to prove it wasn’t an accident. but a deliberate assault. Since my child passed,. I have run around seeking help many times,. yet the killer still walks free. and is even suppressing the truth. My child was once so sunny and kind—. he should not have died bearing injustice,. nor should the killer dismiss his life. with the word “accident.”. I earnestly ask every conscientious compatriot:. if you know any clues from before or after my son’s incident,. if you are willing to speak for justice,. please help forward this petition of grievance,. so more people can know the truth,. return justice to my son,. and justice to this world. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I stand by every word I say. That’s roughly the current progress of Yu’s case. My first thought when looking at this was:. even someone like him—. a male star with 20 million followers inside the Firewall,. under intense public attention—. could be persecuted to death like this. All the more so for ordinary Chinese people. Famous or not,. as long as you’re under CCP rule,. in the eyes of senior cadres,. you and I are no different from “chives.”. Among my viewers. are some little pinks who scale the Firewall to watch. I hope these little pinks. can recognize one thing:. the “great motherland” you praise all day,. the GDP you boast about,. the city high-rises—. none of that is the point,. and none of it is yours. Because in the Party’s eyes,. we’re not people—. we’re just “human ore” to be mined. Those who oppose the CCP. don’t hate it because of skyscrapers,. but because under CCP rule,. people have no rights—. only the lives of high officials count. Even if you’re currently a vested beneficiary inside the Firewall,. with a job better than other “chives,”. it’s only temporary. Look at Yu’s past posts—. did he not love China? He wrote plenty. of patriotic articles. But once he caught the eye of a cadre’s child,. he still ended up with no remains. When the CCP’s iron fist. one day slams into your head,. aside from people like me,. the “rebels” you dislike so much,. there will truly be no one left to speak for you. And think about this:. an artist as famous as Yu inside China. could have all news completely blocked. It’s not hard to imagine. similar cases happen daily inside the Firewall—. unknown to anyone,. because others are even more nameless. So, little pinks, reflect:. while you help the CCP with external propaganda. and conduct cognitive warfare against Taiwan,. the more “successful” you are, the more you hurt yourselves. If your state becomes all-powerful,. no one will be able to save you. And in Taiwan, indeed quite a few people. no longer mind becoming China’s “chives.”. Some are bored of eating proper meals. and suddenly crave eating poop instead. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">What they see. is just the pink bubble you’ve blown up. But deep down you know better than anyone. that it’s fake. You’ve sung the March of the Volunteers so many times—. “Arise, you who refuse to be slaves.”. Was that all fake singing? If Chinese people had some guts,. I’m telling you honestly—. the whole world would help you overthrow the CCP. But if Chinese people willingly kneel as slaves,. then Yu Menglong won’t be the last. What do you all think about this case? Feel free to share below. And other viewers are also welcome. to add more details of Yu’s case. In the second half of today’s video,. let’s look at a few self-own comments on the channel. “Potter King represents the fence-sitters.”. Fence-sitters, huh? I’m a swing voter right now. That’s not fence-sitting—. that’s supporting Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion. But this isn’t the first time I’ve seen such comments. After I shifted my channel’s direction,. I do see these kinds of remarks occasionally. It makes me feel a lot. Is it that the Oscars owe me a statuette,. or that these netizens. truly lack logical thinking skills? They can’t even grasp the meaning of words. Even if you don’t understand what “swing voter” means,. you should at least understand this:. after I’ve walked you through the real China,. if after watching. you still think China is good,. and want to be invaded by the CCP to become Chinese,. then that just shows. you truly love China. In this life,. you’re destined to be the Party’s little chive. Loving it to a tragic end. If that’s really the majority view in Taiwan,. then I can only say it’s fate. And if you can’t understand this,. I suggest you stay off the internet. Seriously, please—. in this era of rampant disinformation,. you really shouldn’t be online. No wonder Taiwan’s losing the info war so badly—. there’s a reason. It reminds me of how some people. couldn’t even tell Bit King, who never shows his face,. from Potter King, who does. I was speechless. But as I said,. scolding won’t help. We can only keep playing into the headwind. And actually, thinking of it another way, it’s fine—. the appearance of such people. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">reveals something very important:. that my pivot was necessary. The purpose of my pivot. was to make dialogue. break through the echo chamber. Now with comments like these appearing,. it shows I’ve succeeded. I’ll keep working hard—. please keep supporting me. There are many ways to love Taiwan—. everyone, keep fighting from your own positions. “Potter King is actually trans. I have evidence but I won’t say it. So Potter King, please post a video to prove it. Thanks. If you don’t dare, that proves you’re guilty.”. The logic of this comment. sounds like kids quarreling in grade school. Wait, no—. if I call you grade-schoolers,. real kids might be offended,. saying, “We’re not that dumb!”. Let me analyze this little pink’s logic. for you all:. first he throws out an accusation,. saying the other person is trans,. then says he has evidence but won’t show it,. and shifts the responsibility back to the accused. He’s the one making the claim,. yet demands the other party film a video to clear themselves. This is a classic case of shifting the burden of proof:. offering no evidence himself,. but requiring others to prove innocence. It’s pure logical fallacy,. with no content and no credibility. Then he adds one more jab:. “If you don’t dare to film, that means you’re guilty.”. Basically he set up a sure-win condition—. no matter how the other side responds,. he can twist it his way. Shameless. But good for self-entertainment. So with this little pink example,. I’ll respond the same way once. Then you’ll know how to reply to these dumb pinks in the future. Here’s how:. I have proof you’re brainless—. but I won’t say it. Please film yourself,. open up your skull,. and prove you have a brain. Ah, if you don’t dare film it,. that means you’re guilty. Proves I was right—. you really are brainless. “Potter King saw Kuan Chang,. now he’s anxious because he can’t lick red money. Mom, love me once more.”. I’m not jealous of Kuan Chang. But since you mention him,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I recall Kuan Chang said himself—. he licked the CCP at his own expense and lost money. And there’s also this recent video of Chinese netizens’ comments on Kuan Chang. I can only say—. pathetic. </p>

But hearing the news was heartbreaking. Hello, Potter King. Could you talk about the Yu Menglong incident in China’s entertainment industry? This matter may involve many celebrities or high-ranking officials. It has already been suppressed inside China. I hope you can help more people pay attention to it. This week I’ve received several such comments. Hoping I would talk about Yu Menglong’s case. But beforehand I wasn’t familiar with this Chinese star. Nor had I seen any of his dramas. But since so many wanted me to talk about it,. I went to research the case. And after understanding what he went through,. I can only say it’s another tragedy of the CCP’s chives. And I do think this case is full of suspicious points. But just now,. many Taiwanese have accepted CCP propaganda. They think being Chinese. seems pretty good. So in this week’s video,. we’ll learn about Yu Menglong’s ordeal. to get a taste of life as a Chinese inside the Great Firewall. After a one-minute ad,. we’ll get right into today’s topic. First I must say,. this case is hard to explain fully. Because the CCP inside China. has already been maintaining stability on it. A lot of the information is fragmented. I can only piece it together in order. If there are parts I didn’t mention,. I welcome informed viewers. to add them in the comments. OK, let me quickly explain. what exactly happened. It started on September 11 at 1:59 p.m. when a paparazzi inside China posted on Weibo. saying Yu Menglong had fallen to his death. At first the news wasn’t confirmed as true or false. The post only had text plus a few photos from the scene. He said he had confirmed with staff. that the one who fell was Yu Menglong. And in one of the photos,. there was a close-up of the window screen where it happened. At first Chinese netizens. could still discuss how weirdly the screen was broken. They questioned who would cut it open and then jump. The incident site was a luxury apartment project in Chaoyang, Beijing. The Sunshine Upper East community. Later that afternoon,. Yu Menglong’s studio released a statement. confirming his death from falling. He was 37. Still very young. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Although this confirmed. the paparazzi’s report was correct,. what’s strange is. Yu Menglong’s studio replaced the police to announce. that the police had ruled out criminal suspicion. Clearly wanting to frame the case as an accidental fall. But Yu Menglong, as. a male star with 20 million fans in China,. suddenly died like this—. it naturally drew huge attention. It even shot up to number one on Weibo’s trending. And that’s when insiders began revealing. that Yu Menglong didn’t fall by accident,. but was thrown off. And not just once. He was thrown twice. The method was extremely cruel. There was even a video. directly filming the window of the crime scene,. the same one in the leaked photos we saw. But the video. was secretly filmed the night before. So the footage is dark. But you can still clearly hear. Yu Menglong’s heart-wrenching cries for help. With his fear of heights,. he was hung upside down outside a 5th-floor window and toyed with. A reminder—the next clip. may make people uncomfortable. It’s real footage of persecution. If you’re especially empathetic,. consider muting the sound. and just reading the subtitles. Even though this might get yellow-tagged,. I think it’s necessary to show it. Because this video has already been censored inside China. So by posting it here,. I’m also preserving evidence for the victim. Hoping one day his injustice will be redressed. In addition, reports also pointed out that on the night of his fall... There were multiple people at the scene,. including well-known figures from China’s entertainment industry. It’s said Yu Menglong was set up at a gathering that night,. drugged and plied with alcohol,. and then forced to have relations with a man. Afterward, the other party tossed him two Rolex watches,. trying to buy him off. I’ve also reviewed many related materials. and compiled a few key points to share. Yu was targeted when he debuted at 25. Rumor had it a powerful woman in the industry tried to coerce him,. but he refused,. and was blacklisted for three years,. disappearing from public view,. with no job opportunities. By 2017,. he finally landed work again,. appearing in “Eternal Love” (Three Lives, Three Worlds, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms). As his career began to recover,. he was targeted by someone else,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">who tried to force the unspoken rules on him. That person was later identified. as Xin Qi,. birth name Xin Xiaoxiong,. a film producer. You might ask, can a Chinese film producer. really wield such power over an artist? Perhaps not,. but Xin Qi. isn’t an ordinary producer—. he’s a princeling, the child of a senior CCP official. According to news reports,. Xin Qi is suspected to be. the illegitimate son of Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi. With that princeling background,. his backing inside the Great Firewall is extremely strong. Moreover, Cai Qi. is a Xi loyalist who has been heavily favored,. in charge of China’s online surveillance and stability maintenance. With such a patron behind him,. and a system ruled by men, not law,. where the Party decides everything,. you can imagine that. almost no one could touch Xin Qi. Princelings in China can indeed act with impunity. Even if he treats the entertainment world like a brothel,. it wouldn’t be unheard of. But Xin Qi initially adored Yu,. approaching him under the pretext of organizing a fan club,. with the real aim of getting close and monitoring him. After getting familiar with Yu,. he registered two companies in Yu’s name,. using both carrot and stick. to make Yu sign contracts. Once the partnership was bound,. Xin tried to impose the casting-couch rules on him. But Yu had boundaries,. and still refused at all costs. Yet given Xin’s backing,. Yu had no real recourse against him,. essentially with nowhere to turn. In this desperate moment,. Yu happened to discover. that the two companies in his name. were being used by the other side for money laundering—. acting as a white glove for the CCP. So Yu quietly gathered evidence,. and once he had key proof,. he went to deregister the companies. and stored the evidence on a USB drive. Presumably, Yu intended to use this as leverage. to free himself from Xin’s years of harassment. But because he held evidence of a senior CCP official’s laundering,. he touched the Party’s interests,. and in China’s system of official protectionism,. with Yu still physically inside the Great Firewall,. it instead brought fatal danger upon him. That earlier SOS clip you saw. wasn’t captured by chance,. but because Xin planned a setup against Yu. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and brought in paparazzi to film. Xin originally wanted to use a sex scandal as leverage,. but it ended up accidentally capturing. footage of Yu pleading for help while alive. After this news broke inside China,. it’s easy to imagine. the CCP’s opinion-control machinery kicked in at once:. mass deletions on Weibo, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and more. From trending #1 to vanishing into thin air—. Yu was thus erased from public view. Worse still, there’s more:. Yu’s studio. issued yet another statement to whitewash,. this time invoking Yu’s mother’s name,. aiming to quell netizens’ doubts,. claiming he fell accidentally while drunk,. and asking everyone to stop speculating. But once that statement came out,. Yu’s mother herself. apparently did not accept it. The very next day,. Yu Menglong’s mother anonymously posted online herself,. attaching a fingerprinted handprint to prove it was really her. She stayed anonymous because. the CCP had already banned discussion of Yu’s cause of death. But how could a mother who lost her own child. possibly remain silent? With grievance in her heart,. she chose to speak out under a pseudonym. She didn’t use Yu’s real name—. she called herself “Dou E’s mother.”. By the way,. “The Injustice to Dou E” is a Yuan-dynasty zaju by Guan Hanqing,. about a kind woman who was framed,. tortured and forced into a confession. Because both are injustices,. she used “Dou E” as a stand-in. The gist of Yu’s mother’s statement was:. I hope to seek justice for my child who died wronged. The killer’s claim to the public that it was an accident. is false. I hold key footage from before and after the incident,. plus testimony from insiders,. enough to prove it wasn’t an accident. but a deliberate assault. Since my child passed,. I have run around seeking help many times,. yet the killer still walks free. and is even suppressing the truth. My child was once so sunny and kind—. he should not have died bearing injustice,. nor should the killer dismiss his life. with the word “accident.”. I earnestly ask every conscientious compatriot:. if you know any clues from before or after my son’s incident,. if you are willing to speak for justice,. please help forward this petition of grievance,. so more people can know the truth,. return justice to my son,. and justice to this world. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I stand by every word I say. That’s roughly the current progress of Yu’s case. My first thought when looking at this was:. even someone like him—. a male star with 20 million followers inside the Firewall,. under intense public attention—. could be persecuted to death like this. All the more so for ordinary Chinese people. Famous or not,. as long as you’re under CCP rule,. in the eyes of senior cadres,. you and I are no different from “chives.”. Among my viewers. are some little pinks who scale the Firewall to watch. I hope these little pinks. can recognize one thing:. the “great motherland” you praise all day,. the GDP you boast about,. the city high-rises—. none of that is the point,. and none of it is yours. Because in the Party’s eyes,. we’re not people—. we’re just “human ore” to be mined. Those who oppose the CCP. don’t hate it because of skyscrapers,. but because under CCP rule,. people have no rights—. only the lives of high officials count. Even if you’re currently a vested beneficiary inside the Firewall,. with a job better than other “chives,”. it’s only temporary. Look at Yu’s past posts—. did he not love China? He wrote plenty. of patriotic articles. But once he caught the eye of a cadre’s child,. he still ended up with no remains. When the CCP’s iron fist. one day slams into your head,. aside from people like me,. the “rebels” you dislike so much,. there will truly be no one left to speak for you. And think about this:. an artist as famous as Yu inside China. could have all news completely blocked. It’s not hard to imagine. similar cases happen daily inside the Firewall—. unknown to anyone,. because others are even more nameless. So, little pinks, reflect:. while you help the CCP with external propaganda. and conduct cognitive warfare against Taiwan,. the more “successful” you are, the more you hurt yourselves. If your state becomes all-powerful,. no one will be able to save you. And in Taiwan, indeed quite a few people. no longer mind becoming China’s “chives.”. Some are bored of eating proper meals. and suddenly crave eating poop instead. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">What they see. is just the pink bubble you’ve blown up. But deep down you know better than anyone. that it’s fake. You’ve sung the March of the Volunteers so many times—. “Arise, you who refuse to be slaves.”. Was that all fake singing? If Chinese people had some guts,. I’m telling you honestly—. the whole world would help you overthrow the CCP. But if Chinese people willingly kneel as slaves,. then Yu Menglong won’t be the last. What do you all think about this case? Feel free to share below. And other viewers are also welcome. to add more details of Yu’s case. In the second half of today’s video,. let’s look at a few self-own comments on the channel. “Potter King represents the fence-sitters.”. Fence-sitters, huh? I’m a swing voter right now. That’s not fence-sitting—. that’s supporting Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion. But this isn’t the first time I’ve seen such comments. After I shifted my channel’s direction,. I do see these kinds of remarks occasionally. It makes me feel a lot. Is it that the Oscars owe me a statuette,. or that these netizens. truly lack logical thinking skills? They can’t even grasp the meaning of words. Even if you don’t understand what “swing voter” means,. you should at least understand this:. after I’ve walked you through the real China,. if after watching. you still think China is good,. and want to be invaded by the CCP to become Chinese,. then that just shows. you truly love China. In this life,. you’re destined to be the Party’s little chive. Loving it to a tragic end. If that’s really the majority view in Taiwan,. then I can only say it’s fate. And if you can’t understand this,. I suggest you stay off the internet. Seriously, please—. in this era of rampant disinformation,. you really shouldn’t be online. No wonder Taiwan’s losing the info war so badly—. there’s a reason. It reminds me of how some people. couldn’t even tell Bit King, who never shows his face,. from Potter King, who does. I was speechless. But as I said,. scolding won’t help. We can only keep playing into the headwind. And actually, thinking of it another way, it’s fine—. the appearance of such people. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">reveals something very important:. that my pivot was necessary. The purpose of my pivot. was to make dialogue. break through the echo chamber. Now with comments like these appearing,. it shows I’ve succeeded. I’ll keep working hard—. please keep supporting me. There are many ways to love Taiwan—. everyone, keep fighting from your own positions. “Potter King is actually trans. I have evidence but I won’t say it. So Potter King, please post a video to prove it. Thanks. If you don’t dare, that proves you’re guilty.”. The logic of this comment. sounds like kids quarreling in grade school. Wait, no—. if I call you grade-schoolers,. real kids might be offended,. saying, “We’re not that dumb!”. Let me analyze this little pink’s logic. for you all:. first he throws out an accusation,. saying the other person is trans,. then says he has evidence but won’t show it,. and shifts the responsibility back to the accused. He’s the one making the claim,. yet demands the other party film a video to clear themselves. This is a classic case of shifting the burden of proof:. offering no evidence himself,. but requiring others to prove innocence. It’s pure logical fallacy,. with no content and no credibility. Then he adds one more jab:. “If you don’t dare to film, that means you’re guilty.”. Basically he set up a sure-win condition—. no matter how the other side responds,. he can twist it his way. Shameless. But good for self-entertainment. So with this little pink example,. I’ll respond the same way once. Then you’ll know how to reply to these dumb pinks in the future. Here’s how:. I have proof you’re brainless—. but I won’t say it. Please film yourself,. open up your skull,. and prove you have a brain. Ah, if you don’t dare film it,. that means you’re guilty. Proves I was right—. you really are brainless. “Potter King saw Kuan Chang,. now he’s anxious because he can’t lick red money. Mom, love me once more.”. I’m not jealous of Kuan Chang. But since you mention him,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I recall Kuan Chang said himself—. he licked the CCP at his own expense and lost money. And there’s also this recent video of Chinese netizens’ comments on Kuan Chang. I can only say—. pathetic. </p>

This matter may involve many celebrities or high-ranking officials. It has already been suppressed inside China. I hope you can help more people pay attention to it. This week I’ve received several such comments. Hoping I would talk about Yu Menglong’s case. But beforehand I wasn’t familiar with this Chinese star. Nor had I seen any of his dramas. But since so many wanted me to talk about it,. I went to research the case. And after understanding what he went through,. I can only say it’s another tragedy of the CCP’s chives. And I do think this case is full of suspicious points. But just now,. many Taiwanese have accepted CCP propaganda. They think being Chinese. seems pretty good. So in this week’s video,. we’ll learn about Yu Menglong’s ordeal. to get a taste of life as a Chinese inside the Great Firewall. After a one-minute ad,. we’ll get right into today’s topic. First I must say,. this case is hard to explain fully. Because the CCP inside China. has already been maintaining stability on it. A lot of the information is fragmented. I can only piece it together in order. If there are parts I didn’t mention,. I welcome informed viewers. to add them in the comments. OK, let me quickly explain. what exactly happened. It started on September 11 at 1:59 p.m. when a paparazzi inside China posted on Weibo. saying Yu Menglong had fallen to his death. At first the news wasn’t confirmed as true or false. The post only had text plus a few photos from the scene. He said he had confirmed with staff. that the one who fell was Yu Menglong. And in one of the photos,. there was a close-up of the window screen where it happened. At first Chinese netizens. could still discuss how weirdly the screen was broken. They questioned who would cut it open and then jump. The incident site was a luxury apartment project in Chaoyang, Beijing. The Sunshine Upper East community. Later that afternoon,. Yu Menglong’s studio released a statement. confirming his death from falling. He was 37. Still very young. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">Although this confirmed. the paparazzi’s report was correct,. what’s strange is. Yu Menglong’s studio replaced the police to announce. that the police had ruled out criminal suspicion. Clearly wanting to frame the case as an accidental fall. But Yu Menglong, as. a male star with 20 million fans in China,. suddenly died like this—. it naturally drew huge attention. It even shot up to number one on Weibo’s trending. And that’s when insiders began revealing. that Yu Menglong didn’t fall by accident,. but was thrown off. And not just once. He was thrown twice. The method was extremely cruel. There was even a video. directly filming the window of the crime scene,. the same one in the leaked photos we saw. But the video. was secretly filmed the night before. So the footage is dark. But you can still clearly hear. Yu Menglong’s heart-wrenching cries for help. With his fear of heights,. he was hung upside down outside a 5th-floor window and toyed with. A reminder—the next clip. may make people uncomfortable. It’s real footage of persecution. If you’re especially empathetic,. consider muting the sound. and just reading the subtitles. Even though this might get yellow-tagged,. I think it’s necessary to show it. Because this video has already been censored inside China. So by posting it here,. I’m also preserving evidence for the victim. Hoping one day his injustice will be redressed. In addition, reports also pointed out that on the night of his fall... There were multiple people at the scene,. including well-known figures from China’s entertainment industry. It’s said Yu Menglong was set up at a gathering that night,. drugged and plied with alcohol,. and then forced to have relations with a man. Afterward, the other party tossed him two Rolex watches,. trying to buy him off. I’ve also reviewed many related materials. and compiled a few key points to share. Yu was targeted when he debuted at 25. Rumor had it a powerful woman in the industry tried to coerce him,. but he refused,. and was blacklisted for three years,. disappearing from public view,. with no job opportunities. By 2017,. he finally landed work again,. appearing in “Eternal Love” (Three Lives, Three Worlds, Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms). As his career began to recover,. he was targeted by someone else,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">who tried to force the unspoken rules on him. That person was later identified. as Xin Qi,. birth name Xin Xiaoxiong,. a film producer. You might ask, can a Chinese film producer. really wield such power over an artist? Perhaps not,. but Xin Qi. isn’t an ordinary producer—. he’s a princeling, the child of a senior CCP official. According to news reports,. Xin Qi is suspected to be. the illegitimate son of Politburo Standing Committee member Cai Qi. With that princeling background,. his backing inside the Great Firewall is extremely strong. Moreover, Cai Qi. is a Xi loyalist who has been heavily favored,. in charge of China’s online surveillance and stability maintenance. With such a patron behind him,. and a system ruled by men, not law,. where the Party decides everything,. you can imagine that. almost no one could touch Xin Qi. Princelings in China can indeed act with impunity. Even if he treats the entertainment world like a brothel,. it wouldn’t be unheard of. But Xin Qi initially adored Yu,. approaching him under the pretext of organizing a fan club,. with the real aim of getting close and monitoring him. After getting familiar with Yu,. he registered two companies in Yu’s name,. using both carrot and stick. to make Yu sign contracts. Once the partnership was bound,. Xin tried to impose the casting-couch rules on him. But Yu had boundaries,. and still refused at all costs. Yet given Xin’s backing,. Yu had no real recourse against him,. essentially with nowhere to turn. In this desperate moment,. Yu happened to discover. that the two companies in his name. were being used by the other side for money laundering—. acting as a white glove for the CCP. So Yu quietly gathered evidence,. and once he had key proof,. he went to deregister the companies. and stored the evidence on a USB drive. Presumably, Yu intended to use this as leverage. to free himself from Xin’s years of harassment. But because he held evidence of a senior CCP official’s laundering,. he touched the Party’s interests,. and in China’s system of official protectionism,. with Yu still physically inside the Great Firewall,. it instead brought fatal danger upon him. That earlier SOS clip you saw. wasn’t captured by chance,. but because Xin planned a setup against Yu. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">and brought in paparazzi to film. Xin originally wanted to use a sex scandal as leverage,. but it ended up accidentally capturing. footage of Yu pleading for help while alive. After this news broke inside China,. it’s easy to imagine. the CCP’s opinion-control machinery kicked in at once:. mass deletions on Weibo, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, and more. From trending #1 to vanishing into thin air—. Yu was thus erased from public view. Worse still, there’s more:. Yu’s studio. issued yet another statement to whitewash,. this time invoking Yu’s mother’s name,. aiming to quell netizens’ doubts,. claiming he fell accidentally while drunk,. and asking everyone to stop speculating. But once that statement came out,. Yu’s mother herself. apparently did not accept it. The very next day,. Yu Menglong’s mother anonymously posted online herself,. attaching a fingerprinted handprint to prove it was really her. She stayed anonymous because. the CCP had already banned discussion of Yu’s cause of death. But how could a mother who lost her own child. possibly remain silent? With grievance in her heart,. she chose to speak out under a pseudonym. She didn’t use Yu’s real name—. she called herself “Dou E’s mother.”. By the way,. “The Injustice to Dou E” is a Yuan-dynasty zaju by Guan Hanqing,. about a kind woman who was framed,. tortured and forced into a confession. Because both are injustices,. she used “Dou E” as a stand-in. The gist of Yu’s mother’s statement was:. I hope to seek justice for my child who died wronged. The killer’s claim to the public that it was an accident. is false. I hold key footage from before and after the incident,. plus testimony from insiders,. enough to prove it wasn’t an accident. but a deliberate assault. Since my child passed,. I have run around seeking help many times,. yet the killer still walks free. and is even suppressing the truth. My child was once so sunny and kind—. he should not have died bearing injustice,. nor should the killer dismiss his life. with the word “accident.”. I earnestly ask every conscientious compatriot:. if you know any clues from before or after my son’s incident,. if you are willing to speak for justice,. please help forward this petition of grievance,. so more people can know the truth,. return justice to my son,. and justice to this world. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I stand by every word I say. That’s roughly the current progress of Yu’s case. My first thought when looking at this was:. even someone like him—. a male star with 20 million followers inside the Firewall,. under intense public attention—. could be persecuted to death like this. All the more so for ordinary Chinese people. Famous or not,. as long as you’re under CCP rule,. in the eyes of senior cadres,. you and I are no different from “chives.”. Among my viewers. are some little pinks who scale the Firewall to watch. I hope these little pinks. can recognize one thing:. the “great motherland” you praise all day,. the GDP you boast about,. the city high-rises—. none of that is the point,. and none of it is yours. Because in the Party’s eyes,. we’re not people—. we’re just “human ore” to be mined. Those who oppose the CCP. don’t hate it because of skyscrapers,. but because under CCP rule,. people have no rights—. only the lives of high officials count. Even if you’re currently a vested beneficiary inside the Firewall,. with a job better than other “chives,”. it’s only temporary. Look at Yu’s past posts—. did he not love China? He wrote plenty. of patriotic articles. But once he caught the eye of a cadre’s child,. he still ended up with no remains. When the CCP’s iron fist. one day slams into your head,. aside from people like me,. the “rebels” you dislike so much,. there will truly be no one left to speak for you. And think about this:. an artist as famous as Yu inside China. could have all news completely blocked. It’s not hard to imagine. similar cases happen daily inside the Firewall—. unknown to anyone,. because others are even more nameless. So, little pinks, reflect:. while you help the CCP with external propaganda. and conduct cognitive warfare against Taiwan,. the more “successful” you are, the more you hurt yourselves. If your state becomes all-powerful,. no one will be able to save you. And in Taiwan, indeed quite a few people. no longer mind becoming China’s “chives.”. Some are bored of eating proper meals. and suddenly crave eating poop instead. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">What they see. is just the pink bubble you’ve blown up. But deep down you know better than anyone. that it’s fake. You’ve sung the March of the Volunteers so many times—. “Arise, you who refuse to be slaves.”. Was that all fake singing? If Chinese people had some guts,. I’m telling you honestly—. the whole world would help you overthrow the CCP. But if Chinese people willingly kneel as slaves,. then Yu Menglong won’t be the last. What do you all think about this case? Feel free to share below. And other viewers are also welcome. to add more details of Yu’s case. In the second half of today’s video,. let’s look at a few self-own comments on the channel. “Potter King represents the fence-sitters.”. Fence-sitters, huh? I’m a swing voter right now. That’s not fence-sitting—. that’s supporting Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion. But this isn’t the first time I’ve seen such comments. After I shifted my channel’s direction,. I do see these kinds of remarks occasionally. It makes me feel a lot. Is it that the Oscars owe me a statuette,. or that these netizens. truly lack logical thinking skills? They can’t even grasp the meaning of words. Even if you don’t understand what “swing voter” means,. you should at least understand this:. after I’ve walked you through the real China,. if after watching. you still think China is good,. and want to be invaded by the CCP to become Chinese,. then that just shows. you truly love China. In this life,. you’re destined to be the Party’s little chive. Loving it to a tragic end. If that’s really the majority view in Taiwan,. then I can only say it’s fate. And if you can’t understand this,. I suggest you stay off the internet. Seriously, please—. in this era of rampant disinformation,. you really shouldn’t be online. No wonder Taiwan’s losing the info war so badly—. there’s a reason. It reminds me of how some people. couldn’t even tell Bit King, who never shows his face,. from Potter King, who does. I was speechless. But as I said,. scolding won’t help. We can only keep playing into the headwind. And actually, thinking of it another way, it’s fine—. the appearance of such people. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">reveals something very important:. that my pivot was necessary. The purpose of my pivot. was to make dialogue. break through the echo chamber. Now with comments like these appearing,. it shows I’ve succeeded. I’ll keep working hard—. please keep supporting me. There are many ways to love Taiwan—. everyone, keep fighting from your own positions. “Potter King is actually trans. I have evidence but I won’t say it. So Potter King, please post a video to prove it. Thanks. If you don’t dare, that proves you’re guilty.”. The logic of this comment. sounds like kids quarreling in grade school. Wait, no—. if I call you grade-schoolers,. real kids might be offended,. saying, “We’re not that dumb!”. Let me analyze this little pink’s logic. for you all:. first he throws out an accusation,. saying the other person is trans,. then says he has evidence but won’t show it,. and shifts the responsibility back to the accused. He’s the one making the claim,. yet demands the other party film a video to clear themselves. This is a classic case of shifting the burden of proof:. offering no evidence himself,. but requiring others to prove innocence. It’s pure logical fallacy,. with no content and no credibility. Then he adds one more jab:. “If you don’t dare to film, that means you’re guilty.”. Basically he set up a sure-win condition—. no matter how the other side responds,. he can twist it his way. Shameless. But good for self-entertainment. So with this little pink example,. I’ll respond the same way once. Then you’ll know how to reply to these dumb pinks in the future. Here’s how:. I have proof you’re brainless—. but I won’t say it. Please film yourself,. open up your skull,. and prove you have a brain. Ah, if you don’t dare film it,. that means you’re guilty. Proves I was right—. you really are brainless. “Potter King saw Kuan Chang,. now he’s anxious because he can’t lick red money. Mom, love me once more.”. I’m not jealous of Kuan Chang. But since you mention him,. </p><p style="max-width: calc(100vw - 1rem);  word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word; ">I recall Kuan Chang said himself—. he licked the CCP at his own expense and lost money. And there’s also this recent video of Chinese netizens’ comments on Kuan Chang. I can only say—. pathetic. </p>

<p><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/GOVHV6TrKW0/maxresdefault.jpg" /></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVHV6TrKW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVHV6TrKW0</a></p><h1>值得閱讀的理由</h1> <ul> <li>快速掌握尼泊爾共產黨政府在一週內被推翻的關鍵事件和背景。</li> <li>深入了解中國共產黨對外宣傳策略的漏洞，以及其意識形態在實際操作中如何適得其反。</li> <li>學習如何識別並有效應對網路上的親中言論和資訊戰，特別是針對年輕世代的影響。</li> </ul> <hr /> <h1>摘要</h1> <h2>尼泊爾政權垮台：中國共產黨「治國方針」的反噬</h2> <p>作者在本週影片中揭露了一件震驚國際的大事，即尼泊爾共產黨政府的垮台。這起事件發生在尼泊爾總理奧利（Oli）才剛結束訪中行程、與中國國家主席習近平會面，並出席中國九三閱兵之後。奧利總理在當時表示要加強與中國的「一帶一路」合作，並公開支持「一個中國」原則、反對台獨，被給予貴賓級（VIP）待遇。然而，就在他返回尼泊爾後，情勢急轉直下。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_42.jpg" /></p></p> <h2>社群媒體禁令引爆民怨</h2> <p>事件的導火線是尼泊爾政府突然宣布實施社群媒體禁令，一口氣封鎖了包含臉書、Instagram、YouTube、X（原Twitter）和WhatsApp在內的26個主流社群平台。其給出的理由是這些平台不遵守法規、充斥虛假訊息與仇恨言論，旨在加強人民安全保障。然而，中國官方的抖音（TikTok）、小紅書和微信卻未受影響。這一舉動引發尼泊爾民眾的強烈不滿，因為在當地，政府長期貪腐、官二代炫富已讓民眾積怨已久，這次的禁令無疑是火上加油。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_96.jpg" /></p></p> <h2>抗議升級與政權瓦解</h2> <p>在社群媒體被封鎖後，大批尼泊爾年輕人走上街頭進行和平示威。然而，政府卻動用大批警察鎮壓，衝突從高壓水柱、催淚瓦斯，升級到橡膠子彈，甚至使用真槍實彈。這導致至少30多人喪命、超過千人受傷。憤怒的民眾沖進共產黨官員的家中，將其痛毆並焚燒房屋。包括總統府、國會、最高法院等政府機構也遭到縱火。示威者在總統府內發現並燒毀了習近平的畫作，而尼泊爾共產黨高官則乘坐直升機倉皇逃離。連尼泊爾共產黨的黨部大樓也被焚毀，民眾甚至爬上去扯下錘子鐮刀旗幟。在短短一週內，這個親中的尼泊爾共產黨聯合馬列政府被推翻，全國各地共產黨員遭到清算，參與者多是1995年至2010年間出生的年輕人。尼泊爾總理與多名高官辭職並逃亡，而尼泊爾軍方在此次事件中選擇保持相對中立，未全面鎮壓，部分尼泊爾警方甚至倒戈加入示威民眾。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_127.jpg" /></p></p> <h2>歷史的借鑒與對台灣的啟示</h2> <p>作者指出，尼泊爾的例子再次證明，極權政權並非鐵板一塊，當民眾的怒火不斷累積，政府只把人民當作韭菜收割時，最終只需一個導火線便能瞬間崩解，就像當年的蘇聯一樣。對中國人而言，尼泊爾是一面鏡子，它告訴我們「沒有共產黨，才有新的尼泊爾」，反而讓希望誕生。對於想成為「中國人」的台灣人來說，尼泊爾的例子也值得借鑒，因為第一批被清算的就是那些親中的共產黨員。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_281.jpg" /></p></p> <h2>回應網路留言：識別與反擊資訊戰</h2> <p>作者接著回應了幾則網友留言。對於一則帶有「比中指」符號的留言，作者提醒網友應注意言行，避免在現實中惹禍。而對於一則「不要再分裂台灣」的留言，作者指出，台灣作為民主社會，擁有不同的聲音和立場是正常且成熟的表現，並非分裂。作者進一步分析，該留言者很可能是<strong>中共網軍</strong>，透過發布「藍綠不倒台灣不會好」等言論來帶風向。他強調，真正的問題是中共對台灣的威脅，而非台灣內部的多元意見。作者也引述一位觀眾的經歷，該觀眾發現身邊有朋友受到短影音影響，認為台灣越來越差、中國越來越好。作者提醒大家，中共網軍帳號數量龐大，他們會搭配斷章取義的短片和AI加持，以不了解政治的年輕人為目標，影響力不容小覷。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_317.jpg" /></p></p> <h2>應對資訊戰的策略：從對方在意的點切入</h2> <p>作者建議，面對被中共大外宣欺騙的人，直接用罵的方式效果不彰，因為對方根本聽不進去。我們只能採取「逆風局」的策略，換個方式反擊。例如，可以帶領那些被抖音吸引的年輕人去了解他們所愛的中國，去關注中共不希望他們討論或看到的議題。像是詢問喜歡動漫的年輕人，某部動漫在中國有沒有被禁？女主角的衣服有沒有被「和諧」到看不見？或者有沒有人因為Cosplay動漫角色而被說「辱華」？這些都是切入點。從對方真正在意的事情入手，讓他們看到中國實際的生活狀況，包括薪資、工時、城管對人民的態度，以及言論自由如何被限制。透過比較法，讓他們意識到台灣能上街罵政府卻不會被消失，而中國人光是上訪就會被迫害。最終的目標是讓他們自己去反思，因為「中共病毒染上是需要時間排毒的」，不能操之過急。最後，作者表示，剩下的就看台灣人的智慧與命運了。</p> <p><p><img src="https://democwise2016.github.io/action-RSS-UT-Weekly-202501/file-cache/GOVHV6TrKW0_586.jpg" /></p></p> <hr />
